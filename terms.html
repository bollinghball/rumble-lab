                        <h3>3. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE</h3>
						<h4>A. CERTAIN PRODUCT DISCLAIMERS.</h4>
						<p>WARNING: CHOKING HAZARD – SMALL PARTS. NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER 3 YEARS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE BY CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF THREE (3) AND MAY CONTAIN SMALL PARTS. IN ADDITION TO ALL OTHER LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS AGREEMENT, COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FOR ANY CLAIMS, LIABILITY, DAMAGES, LOSS OR COSTS ARISING FROM SUCH USE.</p>
						<h4>B. Products and Pricing.</h4>
						<p>All products listed on the Site (“Products”), their descriptions, and their prices are each subject to change. Company reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue the sale of any Product with or without notice. You agree that Company will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any Product (except as set forth in Section V). In the event a Product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error or error in pricing or Product information received from our suppliers, we shall have the right, prior to the acceptance of your order (as described below), to decline or cancel any such orders, whether or not the order has been confirmed and/or your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the order and we cancel your order, we shall immediately issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge.</p>
						<h4>C. Orders.</h4>
						<p>When you make an order, you are making an offer to purchase, and such offer is subject to our acceptance. Your receipt of an order confirmation from us does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. We reserve the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline or cancel your order (in whole or in part) for any reason. We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. Your order is not accepted until we send you shipping information for the order (or the accepted portion thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, if we cancel all or a part of your order, your sole and exclusive remedy is either that: </p>
						<ul class="leftList">
							<li>(a) We will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount charged for the cancelled portion (if your credit card has already been charged for the order)</li>
							<li>(b) We will not charge your credit card for the cancelled portion of the order.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>D. Payment Terms</h4>
						<p>For each Product you order on the Site, you agree to pay the price applicable for the Product as of the time you submitted your order (“Product Price”), the delivery fees for the delivery service you select (“Delivery Fees”), and any applicable Taxes (defined below). If you order a subscription to a Product that auto-renews (“Subscription”), then you agree to pay the applicable Product Price, Delivery Fees, and Taxes upon each auto-renewal date, until you terminate your Subscription in accordance with the directions on the Site. Please note that if your Subscription includes a discounted Product Price for a promotional period, once the promotional period expires, your Subscription will renew at the full Product Price. As such, if you purchase a subscription, until such time as you terminate your subscription in accordance with the directions on this site, you hereby authorize, agree and assent to the Company automatically billing your credit card submitted as part of the order process for such amounts that are due. You will be solely responsible for payment of all taxes (other than taxes based on Company’s income), fees, duties, and other governmental charges, and any related penalties and interest, arising from the Product purchase (“Taxes”) not withheld by Company. All payments are non-refundable (except as expressly set forth in this Section II). Without limiting other remedies, we reserve the right to charge a late fee on all past due payments equivalent to the lesser of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month on the unpaid balance or the highest rate allowed by law. You agree to pay for all collection costs, attorney’s fees, and court costs incurred in the collection of past due amounts.</p>
						<h4>E. Shipping Policy.</h4>
						<p>Products will be shipped in accordance with the shipping method you selected when placing the order. Any delivery dates provided by Company are estimates. Company reserves the right to make deliveries in installments. Company will send you an email when your order has shipped and you may review your order and shipping information on your Account. Currently, we ship to the US only.</p>
						<h4>F. Cancellation Policy.</h4>
						<p>You can cancel a monthly subscription any time after the first crate ships. Please cancel by 7:00 PM EST on the 4th of the month if you do not wish to receive that month’s crate (we bill on the 5th of each month). Gift subscriptions are not eligible for cancellation - these subscriptions will expire after the original term is complete. Auto-renewing subscriptions can be turned “off” at any time - meaning we will cancel the next automatic renewal of the subscription (instead, the subscription will expire). Auto-renewing subscriptions cannot be canceled mid-term. If you signed up for the free trial, you have 14 days after your trial crate ships to cancel your subscription before you will start being charged for the auto-renewing monthly subscription.</p>
						<p>To cancel, please call (803)322-7579 or email <a href="mailto:rumble@RumbleLab.com">rumble@rumblelab.com</a> .</p>

						<h3>VII. MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS</h3>
						<h4>A. Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver; Waiver of Trial by Jury.</h4>
						<p>Please read this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>
						<p>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>
						<p>Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS, Inc. (formerly Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms (“Arbitration Rules”). The JAMS rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within one hundred (100) miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States (in which case hearing will be held in the capital of your country), and unless the parties agree otherwise. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
						<p>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected as provided above, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.</p>
						<p>Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Company.</p>
						<p>Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, or under paragraph 11 of this Arbitration Agreement, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
						<p>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. In the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes shall be resolved in a court located in Santa Clara County, California.</p>
						<p>Confidentiality. No part of the procedures shall be open to the public or the media. All evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order or unless required by law. This Paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>
						<p>Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
						<p>Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.</p>
						<p>Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>
						<p>Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California, for such purpose.</p>
						<h4>B. Governing Law</h4>
						<p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may require the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p>
						<h4>C. Modifications to Terms</h4>
						<p>We may change these Terms from time to time. Any such changes will become effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site or Services. If you object to any such changes, your sole recourse will be to cease using the Site and the Services (including the Downloadable Tools). Continued use of the Site or the Services (including any Downloadable Tools) following posting of any such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and your agreement to be bound by the revised Terms, inclusive of such changes. In addition, certain features of the Services may be subject to additional terms of use. By using such features, or any part thereof, you agree to be bound by the additional terms of use applicable to such features. In the event that any of the additional terms of use governing such area conflict with these Terms, the additional terms will govern.</p>
						<h4>D. Modifications to Services.</h4>
						<p>We reserve the right to modify the Site and/or Services at any time without notice. If you object to any changes to the Site or Services, your sole recourse will be to cease using the Site and Service, terminate your Subscription for a pro-rata refund of any amounts you have pre-paid for the Subscription (if any), or not renew the Subscription (if applicable). Continued use of the Site or Services following posting of any such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and satisfaction with the Services as so modified. We also reserve the right to discontinue the Site and/or Services at any time without notice. We will not be liable to you or any third-party should we exercise our right to modify or discontinue the Site or the Services, except and if otherwise expressly set forth in Section V.</p>
						<h4>E. General Terms</h4>
						<p>You agree to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to your use of the Site, the Services (including the Downloadable Tools) and the Products. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the intentions reflected in the invalid provision, and the other provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word including means including without limitation. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with regard to the matters described above. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.</p>
